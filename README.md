# Winter School 2025: Basic Astro Tutorial

---
Let us assume we want to study an object in the sky. For example, consider Abell 370, a cluster of galaxies. 
Now, let us ask some questions.
   - How does Abell 370 look in the sky?
      - Abell 370 is a cluster of galaxies, and it cannot be seen with the naked eye. 
      - We need a telescope (don't try to build a new one).
      - Find which of the existing telescopes has already observed/seen it.
   
   - Where to look?
      - Depends on wavelength coverage. Let us restrict ourselves to optical and infrared. 
      For this, we go to MAST (https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html)
